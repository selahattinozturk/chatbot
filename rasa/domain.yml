  - text: "Hi! Ovulation is most likely over and you`re in the luteal phase now. Would you like to learn more about what happens in your body at this time and get some good tips?"
  utter_day12:
  - text: "The luteal phase begins after ovulation and ends with the start of your next period."
  utter_day13:
  - text: "Let`s talk about your emotions. How does your mood change a few weeks before a period?"
  utter_day14:
  - text: "During the luteal phase your mood can be unpredictable. Dramatic fluctuations in hormone levels are to blame."
  utter_day15:
  - text: "Breathing exercises, yoga, and outdoor walks can help improve your mood."

  utter_day18:
  - text: "https://flo.health/about-us/johannes-bitzer"
  utter_day19:
  - text: "Now, we`d like to show you what`s happening inside your body during the luteal phase."
  utter_day110:
  - text: "An egg is released from the follicle and moves along the uterine tube into the uterus. If conception doesn`t occur, the egg disintegrates."
  utter_day111:
  - text: "The follicle then becomes the corpus luteum, which produces the female sex hormone progesterone. By the end of the cycle, its levels decrease and the uterine lining sheds - that`s when your period starts."
  utter_day112:
  - text: "Luteal phase length is relatively stable. If you know the exact day of your ovulation, you can be almost sure your next period will arrive 10-16 days later."
  utter_day113:
  - text: "In Flo, the default length of the luteal phase is set as 14 days. You can rely on Flo`s calculations or calculate the length of your luteal phase yourself to make the app even more tailored to you. Want to calculate it?"
  utter_day114:

  utter_day22:
  - text: "Did you know some people believe that PMS isn`t real? What do you think?"
  utter_day23:
  - text: "You bet it does! Doctors list about 100 different symptoms of premenstrual syndrome. These are the most frequent ones."
  utter_day24:
  - text: "Hormones are responsible for this. After ovulation, estrogen levels drop, while progesterone levels rise. A high progesterone level is very important for the female body during this time in the event of pregnancy, but it`s also responsible for many of the symptoms that a woman experiences during PMS."
  utter_day25:
  - text: "Have you experienced any PMS symptoms?"

  utter_day214:
  - text: "Hormones are once again to blame! It`s fine to eat what you want, as long as you listen to your body`s cues."
  utter_day215:
  - text: "How can you manage your cravings? Here are a few tips"
  utter_day216:

  utter_day221:
  - text: "Curiously enough, not only the face, body, and limbs, but also the breasts may become swollen during this period. They also become more sensitive due to this fluid retention."

  utter_day227:
  - text: "You may already know this, but PMS can cause certain digestive symptoms. Which of the following do you experience during this time?"
  utter_day228:
  - text: "Progesterone relaxes the smooth muscles of the internal organs. That is why digestive problems may occur. Try to switch to lighter food on these days."
  utter_day229:
  - text: "Increased progesterone is not the root cause of all problems before menstruation. Another term to remember  - androgens."
  utter_day230:
  - text: "These are male hormones that are also found in women. They fluctuate after ovulation, which can affect your appearance. Please select."
  utter_day231:
  - text: "try to avoid touching your skin and hair because it can exacerbate oiliness. Everything will get back to normal soon."

  - text: "Finally, 1-2 days before menstruation, there may be pain in the lower abdomen or back. Have you experienced this?"
